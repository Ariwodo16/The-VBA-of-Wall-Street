# The VBA of Wall Street

## Background

You are well on your way to becoming a programmer and Excel master! In this challenge, you will use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you may choose to challenge yourself with a few of the challenge tasks.

### Files

* [Test Data](Resources/alphabetical_testing.xlsx) - Use this while developing your scripts.

* [Stock Data](Resources/Multiple_year_stock_data.xlsx) - Run your scripts on this data to generate the final report.

### Stock Market Analyst

## Instructions

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

**Note:** Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

The result should match the following image:

## Bonus

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to allow it to run on every worksheet (that is, every year) just by running the VBA script once.

## Other Considerations

* Use the sheet `alphabetical_testing.xlsx` while developing your code. This data set is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in less than 3 to 5 minutes.

* Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with one click of a button.
